Honestly? Max credit to {}. I couldnt have survived through training without their knowledge and help. It was pretty goofy when they were {}, {}, and {} on occasion!
Can {} be any better of a person? MVP or MVRE (Most valued revature employee)! Loved Teams! We would often joke about being {}, while working on our {} and {} skills.
Watch out world! {} is here to make it a better place! They managed to not be {}, {} or {}! Couldnt ask for more!
Felt a genuine connection with {}. Theyre the main reason why I wish we werent virtual. Wouldve loved to talk more indepth about {}, {} and {} in person.
